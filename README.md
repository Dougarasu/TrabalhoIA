# Simulation of a Multi-agent System based in termite colony

A simulation that shows the usage of intelligent agents, programmed with a simple set of rules, to solve the problem of piling up scattered woods in a closed 3D environment.

## Methodology

It was used the rigidbody system from Unity framework, with attributes such as:
* Position (x, y, z)
* Rotation (x, y, z)
* Angular Speed
* Linear Speed
* Mass

### The Agents

Each agent, represented by a digital termite, has only two rules:

* IF a termite find a log, and IF it is already carrying one, THEN he will leave the log nearby the one found and continue wandering randomly in the scenario;
*	IF a termite find a log, and IF it is not carrying one, THEN it grabs the log found and continue wandering randomly in the scenario.

Each agent has a 3D structure such as:

* **Body** - 

* **Motion Actuator** - 

* **Sensors** - 

  * **Wall Sensor** - 
  
  * **Log Sensor** -
